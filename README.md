# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Given that Louiseâ€™s play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time, an analysis will be made to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### The first analysis made was the comparison among the number of "successful", "failed" and "canceled" theater kickstarter projects, based on the month they were launched.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### The last analysis made was the comparison of the percentage of "successful", "failed" and "canceled" play kickstater projects, based on the goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Challenges and/or difficulties may be found if appropriate attention to detail is not taken; for example, in the analysis of outcomes based on launch date, "live" kickstarter projects need to be removed from the analysis and only "theater" kickstarter projects should be taken into account.

#### Specifically in the analysis of oucomes based on golas, challegnes and/or difficulties may be found in the definition of the groups of the goal amount can be omit data, if they are not set properly. It is advised to double-check that totals are correct.

## Results

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### The period from may to august has the largest upside of "successful" theater kickstarter projects; may is the highest, with a total of 111 "successful" theater kickstarter projects.

#### December is the least attractive month to launch a theater kickstarter project, as the number of "successful" projects (37) is nearly the same as the "failed" ones (35).

### - Outcomes Based on Goals

#### Plays kickstarter projects with goals lower than 15,000 are most likely to be successful. The percentage of successful plays kickstarter projects is higher than 50%.

#### Plays kickstarter projects with goals higher than 45,000 have a very low chance of success. The percentage of successful plays kickstarter projects is very low, under 15%.

### Limitations in the Analysis

#### Dataset contains a reduced number of variables that can be used to analyze quantitatively the kickstarters projects. However, there must  be qualitative variables that influenced the outcome of these projects that need to be considered, in order to have a broader point of view and enhance the decision making process. For instance, additional variables that could be added are: quality of the kickstarter project (is it any good?), marketing strategy, target population groups, etc.

### Further Analysis

#### In order to enhance the analysis made, it could be useful to drill-down and search for success ratios in specific countries and search for possible trends over time.
